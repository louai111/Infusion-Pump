This project presents an **Arduino-based infusion pump** with an integrated **drug library feature**. Designed to ensure safe and accurate delivery of intravenous fluids and medications, this system supports two operational modes: manual input of the flow rate or automatic calculation based on drug selection and patient age. 

Key safety features include occlusion detection, which triggers a buzzer alarm in case of flow blockage, and precise control of the infusion rate using a pump and flow sensor. The infusion pump system is ideal for clinical settings, ensuring accurate medication delivery and patient safety.

## Key Features

- **Dual Operational Modes**:
  - Manual entry of flow rate for user-defined control.
  - Automatic flow rate calculation using the drug library and patient age input.
  
- **Drug Library Integration**:  
  - Supports three pre-programmed drugs with preset safe dosage ranges.  
  - Automatically adjusts flow rates based on patient age to ensure precision and compliance with dosing guidelines.

- **Occlusion Detection**:  
  - Real-time monitoring using a flow sensor.  
  - Alerts through a buzzer alarm and LED indication when occlusion is detected.

- **Accurate Flow Rate Control**:  
  - Uses a pump driven by a BJT transistor circuit to achieve smooth and precise flow regulation.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  - Simplified input for flow rate, drug selection, and patient age.  
  - Visual and auditory feedback for error handling and status updates.

## Modes of Operation

1. **Manual Mode**:  
   - The user inputs the desired flow rate (in mL/h).  
   - The pump operates at the specified rate, monitored by the flow sensor for accuracy.

2. **Automatic Mode**:  
   - The user selects one of three pre-set drugs from the library.  
   - After specifying the patientâ€™s age, the system calculates the appropriate flow rate based on dosage guidelines.  
   - The pump automatically adjusts to the calculated rate.

## System Components

- **Pump**: Mechanism for controlled fluid delivery.
- **Flow Sensor**: Monitors the fluid flow rate in real-time for accuracy and occlusion detection.
- **BJT Transistor**: Controls the motor driving the pump for precise flow regulation.
- **Buzzer**: Emits an audible alarm in case of occlusion or errors.
- **Arduino**: Microcontroller for managing inputs, calculations, and outputs.
- **Drug Library**: Pre-programmed database of three drugs with dosage parameters based on patient age.
